## Theoretical framework
## Homework
Using Python compute the following probabilities. For each try to determine which method you applied.<br>
1. Flip a coin 10 times, how many possible outcomes are part of the sample space?
2. In an airport there are 10 passengers waiting in the pre-boarding hall, the police must control 3 of them. How many possible combinations can be obtained?
3. The National Road Safety Agency conducted an investigation to find out if drivers are wearing their seat belts. The sample data were the following:<br>
Seat-belt drivers <br>

- a) What method do you think was used to assign probabilities?
- b) Construct a similar table, but with the assignment of probabilities.
- c) What would be the best method to estimate the probability that a driver in the United States is wearing a seat belt?
- d) One year before, the probability in Argentina that a driver was wearing a seat belt was 0.75. The director of ANSV, the probability was expected to reach 0.78. Will you be satisfied with the results of the study? (Use attached table)<br>

- e) What is the probability that the seat belt is used in the different regions of the country? In which region is the belt used more? (Use the same table as the previous exercise).
4. Create a function that allows calculating the probability of the following events in a deck of 52 cards.<br>
- Get a red card.<br>
- Get a black card.<br>
- Get a pike.<br>
- Get a clover.<br>
- Get a heart.<br>
- Get a diamond.<br>
5. The probability that a 7 or an 8 will come up when selecting a card from a deck of the 52 cards that the deck contains. <br>
6. The probability of your country winning the soccer world cup.<br>
7. An experiment that has three outcomes is repeated 50 times and E1 is seen to appear 20 times, E2 13 times, and E3 17 times. Assign probabilities to outcomes.<br>
## Companion Challenges

1. If the probability that a customer pays in cash (E) is 6/15, with a credit card (TD) it is 7/15 and with a debit card (TD) it is 2/15. Find the probability that two successive customers who pay their bills do so:<br>
 a) the first in cash and the second with a credit card.<br>
 b) The two customers in cash<br>
2. The probability that a Henry will fail M1 is 0.8, that he will pass M2 is 0.5, and that he will fail M3 is 0.4.<br>
 (Events do not interfere with each other) <br>
